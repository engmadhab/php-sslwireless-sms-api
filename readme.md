    ['01970420420', ['Obi', '3213']],
    ['01770420420', ['Shipu', '5000']],
    ['01570420420', ['Kaiser', '3214']],
    ['01870420420', ['Eather', '7642']]
]

$msg = $sms->message($users, "Hello %s , Your promo code is: %s")->send();

if ($msg->parameter == 'ok' and $msg->login == 'successfull') {
